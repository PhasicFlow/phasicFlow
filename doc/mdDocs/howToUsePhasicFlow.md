# How to use PhasicFlow {#howToUsePhasicFlow}
Here you will learn how to use PhasicFlow to setup a granular flow simulation. The inputs for simulation are supplied through some text-based files, called file dictionary, located in two folders: `settings` and `caseSetup`. These folders are located under the root case directory. 
All the commands are performed through terminal in which the current working directory is root case directory (you see `settings` and `caseSetup` folders when `ls` command is entered). The states of geometry and particles are stored in time folders with names that represent the time. When simulation is finished, one case use post-processing tool pFlowToVTK to convert the stored results in the time folder into VTK file format. The VTK file format can be read by Paraview. 
A set of tutorials with detailed descriptions are provided to show you how to use PhasicFlow for various granular flow problems. Here is a list of them.
